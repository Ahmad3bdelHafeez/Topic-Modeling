# Topic-Modeling
Extracting the topics that are included within the dataset along with mapping each article to the  corresponding topic names. Each document should be matched to the top three most relevant  topic names including the matching probability score. In this project, I will apply unsupervised  learning technique(s) to extract the topics that are included within the dataset along with  mapping each article to the corresponding topic names. These topics can then be used to search  or understand as a brief about what the article/document is present.
